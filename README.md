This is a simple synchronous Rust client for the [linkding](https://linkding.link/) API with some cross platform support.

Tested with linkding v1.36.0.

## Cross platform

There are [Uniffi](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/) bindings so you can use this for making Android or iOS apps.

The CI is buidling a Swift package that you can download from the releases page.
